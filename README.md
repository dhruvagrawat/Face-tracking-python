# Face-tracking-python
This project is a face tracking code that uses computer vision techniques to detect and track faces in real-time video streams. The code is written in Python and utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

The main features of the face tracking code include:

Detection and tracking of faces in real-time video streams
Ability to track multiple faces simultaneously
Option to save tracked face videos for later analysis
Real-time display of tracked faces with bounding boxes around them
Ability to adjust tracking parameters for different lighting and camera conditions
The face tracking code can be used in a variety of applications such as surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and entertainment. The code is open-source and available for anyone to use and modify under the MIT license.

To use the face tracking code, simply download the code from this GitHub repository and run it on your local machine. Detailed instructions for installation and usage can be found in the README file.

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand the capabilities of the face tracking code. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues if you encounter any problems or have ideas for new features.
